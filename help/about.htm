Arthur V. Edstrom whose program 'Visual Basic MIDI Piano', 
written in 1993, was the starting point for me. The piano like keyboard 
layout in Visual Music is indeed originally created by him. Unfortunately I do not 
have 
his email address or link to his pages. </P>
<P>     The music albums 'The World Power' and 
'Madman's Return' by Snap! and albums by Enigma were great inspiration for creating electronic music. The architecture of Visual Music and MScript&nbsp;was in part driven by their creations and wild imagination!<br>
