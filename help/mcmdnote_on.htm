<H1>  NOTE_ON</H1>
<br>
<h2>Command Format:</h2> <EM>NOTE_ON:&lt;Note name 
or number&gt;,[octave],[volume]</EM>           
    
<br><br>
<h2>What it does:</h2>   Starts playing the 
specified note but doesn't stops playing that note until you call NOFF or STOP. This 
command is similar to a, a#, c c# etc commands to play note except that the interval for how long note 
will be played is not specified. You can use this command to simultaneously play many notes 
within&nbsp;a single tune but it's time taking to calculate and stop the notes. See the examples.
<br><br>
<h2>Short Form:</h2>        &nbsp;&nbsp;NON
<br><br>
<h2>Parameters:</h2><EM><STRONG>Note name or 
number:</STRONG> </EM>   
 Note name (i.e. a,a#,c,c# etc) or direct number of note you want to 
start. <BR><EM><STRONG>Octave:</STRONG></EM> In which octave to play the note. 
Also supports ++ etc operators. If note specified currently set octave is 
used.<BR><STRONG><EM>Volume: </EM></STRONG> Volume with which the note should be played. Also supports 
++ etc operators. If note specified currently set volume is used.
<BR><BR>
<h2>Value constraints:</h2><STRONG><EM>Note 
Number:</EM></STRONG> 0-87 or 
a,a#,b,c,c#,d,d#,e,e#,f,g,g#<BR><STRONG><EM>Octave:</EM></STRONG> 0 - 7 <BR><STRONG><EM>Volume: </EM></STRONG> 
     0-100 
<br><br>
<h2>Remarks: </h2>This command is equivalent to commands 
like a, a#, b. c# etc which plays the note specified by its name instead of 
number. There is no performance issue between two versions. In general playing a 
note by it's name is much more readable then it's number. However this command 
is useful when you want to write the script to play the note whose number is 
stored in a variable. Octave argument is optional but is desirable to improve 
readability. If change the octave before stopping note you must supply octave 
while turning the note off.<br>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
1. Play note for interval = 10
<br><br><CODE><table><tr><td>
INSTRUMENT:Flute <br>
NOTE_ON:a# <BR>WAIT_FOR:10<BR>NOTE_OFF:a#
</td></tr></table></CODE><br>
2. Play the notes a# in octave 3 and c# in octave 4 simultaneously. Insert some delays so that both could be distinguished.
<br><br><CODE><table><tr><td>
      <P>INSTRUMENT:Flute <br>
NOTE_ON:a#,3 'Start a#<BR>WAIT_FOR:3<BR>NOTE_ON:c#,4 'Start c#<BR>WAIT_FOR:50<BR>NOTE_OFF:a#,3 'Stop a#<BR>WAIT_FOR:10<BR>NOTE_OFF:c#,4 'Stop c# 
</P> 
       
</td></tr></table></CODE><br>
